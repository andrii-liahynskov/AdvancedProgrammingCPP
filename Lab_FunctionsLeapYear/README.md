## Lab - Leap Year.

***Task text from the author:***
```
Write a function for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
The system is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible
by 400.

For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.
Write a function that takes in a year as input and returns True if the year is a leap
year, return False otherwise.

Note: background on leap year https ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

which is the year to test.Here is an example call to the function

	int mybirthyear = 2000

	If(isleapyear(mybirthyear)) {

		printf(“Year % i  was a leap year”, mybirthyear)

	}
